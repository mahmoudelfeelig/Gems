# Gems
a Minecraft mod that adds season-inspired gems with unique powers for each holder.

- Target: Fabric on modern Minecraft (1.21.1+; bump to latest Fabric API when available).
- Design: composition-first, low-overhead systems; new gems should be easy to add.
- Specs: see `checklist.md` for the exhaustive feature list (energy, leveling, items, recipes, per-gem passives/abilities).
