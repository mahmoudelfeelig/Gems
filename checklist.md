# Mod spec checklist

- Core gems: Astra, Fire, Flux, Life, Puff, Speed, Strength, Wealth; default gem given to players.
- Leveling: level 1 unlocks all passives. Levels 2-4 unlock abilities sequentially. Level 5 unlocks all remaining abilities (so if a gem has 5+ abilities, the extras all arrive at level 5; if it has fewer, you stop as soon as all are unlocked). Levels 6-10 are buffer levels with no new powers; max level 10.
- Energy/life: start at 3 energy. Death (any cause) loses 1 energy. The tiers are Legendary 5 → Mythical 4 → Elite 3 → Rare 2 → Common 1 → Broken 0; overflow uses Legendary +1…+5 (6-10). Ability availability scales with energy: at 0-1 energy you have no abilities; at 2-4 energy you keep the first (energy-1) abilities (e.g., energy 3 → first two abilities stay active); at 5+ energy you have all abilities. Kills grant +1 energy up to Legendary +5 (10). Legendary +5 adds an enchant glint; if a Legendary +5 player kills a non-broken player, that victim also drops an upgrade item that anyone can consume to gain a level (not usable by a Legendary +5 player).
- Energy gain overflow: above Legendary uses +1…+5 suffix; death reduces suffix before lowering tiers.
- Gem swapping: a Trader item swaps your gem for another gem of your choice of the same level (you keep both gems but only one is active).
- Level/energy upgrade items: craftable upgrade item -> increases gem energy; crafting hearts adds a heart (up to 20 total hearts max).
- Hearts on death: on death drop one consumable heart item (nether star texture). Right-click to gain max health. Cannot drop below 5 max hearts; if at 5, no heart drops and cannot increase past 20 max total hearts (including the original 10 you spawn as).
- Textures: shared gem base texture with palette swaps per gem; custom textures for upgrade items and heart drops.
- Performance/architecture: composition-first modular system; keep per-tick load minimal; abilities and passives should register/unregister cleanly; add tests/benchmarks as we go.

## Recipes
- Heart (`gems:heart`): shaped `NIN / IGI / NIN` where `N=netherite_scrap`, `I=iron_block`, `G=gold_block`.
- Energy Upgrade (`gems:energy_upgrade`): shaped `NEN / EDE / NEN` where `N=netherite_scrap`, `E=emerald_block`, `D=diamond_block`.
- Trader (`gems:trader`): shaped `DBD / BWB / DBD` where `D=diamond_block`, `B=dragon_breath`, `W=wither_skeleton_skull`.
  - Use: opens a GUI to pick a new gem; consumes 1 Trader and replaces your owned gems with the selected gem (which becomes active).
