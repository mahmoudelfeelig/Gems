# Advanced systems

These systems expand customization, team play, and long-term goals. All numbers and caps are configurable by the server.

## Loadout presets (energy 6+)

- Presets unlock at energy 6.
- Save per-gem ability order, passive toggles, and HUD layout.
- Switching presets respects your current unlocks and energy gating.

## Gem augments

- Craftable items that add modifiers to gem abilities/passives.
- Augments require a player head and unique ingredients.
- Gems have up to 4 augment slots (default), with 3 rarity tiers (default).
- Rarity affects strength/roll ranges; conflicts prevent incompatible combos.
- Slot counts, rarity tiers, roll weights, and magnitudes are configurable.

## Legendary item customization

- Legendary items accept inscription-style augments.
- Legendary items have up to 2 slots (default), with 3 rarity tiers (default).
- Two categories:
  - Universal: works on any legendary item.
  - Item-specific: only works on one legendary item.
- Slot counts, rarity tiers, roll weights, and magnitudes are configurable.

## Team synergies

- A synergy triggers when two or more different gem abilities are cast within a short window.
- Works for multi-gem players casting their own abilities and across trusted allies.
- Synergy effects are unique bonuses with their own cooldowns.

## Gem mastery tracks (cosmetic)

- Each gem has a mastery track that unlocks titles and aura particles.
- Cosmetics are customizable: mix unlocked titles and aura effects.
- Mastery rewards are cosmetic only (no power changes).
- The mastery tracks depend on how much you use certain abilities.

## Rivalry

- On spawn, you are assigned one target you deal extra damage to.
- The bonus persists until you kill that target, then you reroll (the same player can be selected again).
- You should be able to see your current target in your HUD.
- The target can be a trusted player; you cannot target yourself.
