# Bonus abilities and passives

At energy 10/10, any gem holder can claim up to 2 bonus abilities and 2 bonus passives from a server-wide pool. Press B (default keybind) to open the selection UI:
- Most gems: Bonus Selection screen
- Prism: Prism Selection screen (includes bonus pool tabs)

Key mechanics:
- Claims are unique per player - once claimed, no other player can use that ability/passive until it is released.
- Bonus abilities are cast using the `Bonus Ability 1` and `Bonus Ability 2` keybinds (default C and V).
- Bonus passives are automatically applied while claimed and active.
- Claims are released when your energy drops below 10 (you will be notified).
- All bonus abilities have configurable cooldowns, damage values, and radii in the balance config (`bonusPool.*`).
