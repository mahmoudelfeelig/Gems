# Trust and ownership

This doc describes the rules around trusting other players and owning gems.

## Trust and ownership

- Trust only affects ally-targeted effects. PVP is always allowed.
- Gem items are bound to their owner. You can hold multiple gems, but only one is active.
- Activating another player's gem kills them, skips their heart drop, reduces their max hearts by 2, and caps their energy at 1.

For the trust commands (`/gems trust`, `/gems untrust`, etc), see `server-ops.md`.
