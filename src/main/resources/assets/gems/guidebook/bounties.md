# Bounties

Bounties let players place rewards on other players. Rewards are paid out when the target is killed.

## How To Use

- Open the Bounty Board with `/gems bounty`.
- Use the **Active** tab to see current bounties.
- Use the **Place** tab to select a target and set hearts/energy.

## Placement Rules

- Only non-assassins can place bounties.
- You can only place bounties on online players.
- Bounty costs are deducted immediately.
- Heart bounties cannot drop you below 5 max hearts.
- Energy bounties cannot drop you below 0 and are clamped to your current energy.
- You can raise an existing bounty only if you do not reduce hearts or energy and at least one value increases.

## Claim Rules

- If anyone kills the target, they receive all rewards placed on that target.
- If the target kills a placer, the target receives that placer's bounty.
- Heart rewards are given as Heart items and drop if your inventory is full.
- Energy rewards are given as Energy Upgrade items.
- Bounty rewards are in addition to normal kill drops.

## Assassin Void

- If a bounty target becomes an assassin, all bounties on them are removed.
