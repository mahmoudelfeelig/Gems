# Gems (Abilities and Passives)

Passives and abilities are gated by energy. See the Progression section for details.

## Gem augments

- Craftable items that add modifiers to gem abilities/passives.
- Augments require a player head and unique ingredients.
- Gems have up to 4 augment slots (default), with 3 rarity tiers (default).
- Augments are stored on the gem item itself, so two copies of the same gem can have different augments.
- Rarity affects strength/roll ranges; conflicts prevent incompatible combos.
- Slot counts, rarity tiers, roll weights, and magnitudes are configurable.
- Apply a gem augment by right-clicking while the augment is in your hand and the gem is in your other hand.
- Use the augment screen (default U) while holding a gem to view or remove augments on that specific item.
- Each augment rolls a rarity on craft; the rolled rarity scales its strength.
