# Synergies

Synergies trigger when multiple gems (or specific abilities) are cast within a short window (default 3 seconds). This works across **mutually trusted** allies and also for multi-gem players (Prism). Synergy effects are unique bonuses with their own cooldowns (default 30 seconds). A brief HUD message (about 3 seconds) appears on trigger.
