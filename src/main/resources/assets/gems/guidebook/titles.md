# Titles

Titles are cosmetic labels that display in chat and the tab list. They come from gem mastery and from leaderboard categories.

## Unlocking

- **Mastery titles**: use gem abilities to unlock two epic titles per gem (100/500 uses).
- **Leaderboard titles**: server-wide titles refresh every minute based on current stats (kills, deaths, synergy triggers, total casts, damage dealt, and per-gem kills).

## Using titles

- Open the Title Selection screen (default keybind: M).
- Select any unlocked title, or use Clear to remove your selection.
- If you have no selection, the game shows your current leaderboard title (if any), otherwise your highest unlocked title for your active gem.

## Colors and aura

- Each title has its own color for chat and the tab list.
- Your chat message text uses your title color.
- If no aura is selected, your aura color follows your title color.
- Skinshifted chat uses the target's title and color.

## Admin titles

- Admins can set or clear titles; admin-forced titles are labeled in the list.
